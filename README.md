# TreasureGenerator
Generate random treasures for Pathfinder RPG

1. Basic idea is to allow a choice of the tables in the Core Rulebook, the GMG or Ultimate Equipment. 
Need to look at the licenses on the last two to see if I can add the items or just point people in the right direction.

2. Allow adding tables from other splat books, along with some picks on how often the splat book items show up vs. the core
stuff.

3. Allow GMs to save and restore generated items.

4. Allow printing of items.

5. Basic module will be a DLL, which can be included in other applications (web application, console application, WPF application).

6. Written in C#. Hopefully this will help with learning the language and the .NET Framework.
